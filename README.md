## Description

Create "Password manager" app to manage all your passwords for different accounts (mails, devices, accounts, servers, etc.). Push it to your own GitHub repository and send the link back to us.

> App should have at least 3 pages: login, register, dashboard (main logged in view).
> User should be able to add/edit/delete/reveal passwords on the dashboard after login.
> By default passwords should be hidden with "*", there should be an ability to reveal password (button, etc.).
> All password data should be stored somewhere, so when user reloads pages, they will be redirected back to the dashboard and all the passwords will be fetched.
> All password data saves in local storage.
